# Random Donald Trump Quote Generator
---
This application fetches a new random quote each time the button is pressed or page refreshed and displays it in the browser. I developed this app using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript practices by: 

* Using DOM manipulation to Select 
* Elements on the page
* Event Listeners on an element
* Fetch random quotes using an API
* Displays the quote on the page
* Shows a loading indicator
* Button to allow you to Tweet the generated quote
* New Quote Displayed each time page is refreshed
